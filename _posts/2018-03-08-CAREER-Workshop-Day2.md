The second day of the workshop was dedicated to twenty minute one-on-one meetings with program directors.  Here I summarize my meeting with SHF program director Dr. Nina Amla.

The questions I brought with me were:

- What upper bound should I be sticking to?  I need a five year postdoc, but with my salary, travel, and undergrads, I might be over $500,000.
- What is the typical salary range for postdocs in CISE?
- Advice on timeline:
  - I am now using phases instead of being very specific.
- How much should I assume?
  - Will my reviewers know what "dependent types" and "substructural logics" mean?
- What kind of things are not allowed on a CAREER budget?
  - Can we include meeting funds?  For example, for workshops, summer schools, or seminars?
- Get her feedback on Pull CS Back
- Ask her about my new high level approach:
  - Dependent types for substructural logics
  - Far reaching goal: proof assistants and functional programming languages capable of making use of and reason about resource sensitive typing.
  - Blending these logics together, not just using them in isolation.
- Education:
  - New open-source tools, good idea?
  - This incorporates research on dependent types and disseminates the ideas.
- Does she have any feedback on the last one?
