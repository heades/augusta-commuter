It's May, and so, [Mental Health Awareness Month](https://www.nami.org/mentalhealthmonth).  I generally feel less alone when I know of others who deal with similar problems, and even more so when those people are generally successful in their life.  In this post, I would like to share my story and problems I deal with in the hope that someone out there might feel less alone.

This post is extremely hard for me to write.  The things I am going to reveal are things I have kept a secret for a very long time.  I think of this post as a bit of therapy for myself as much as it is -- hopefully -- useful to others.

I am an assistant professor in computer science at [Augusta University](http://www.augusta.edu/), I have Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), suffer from anxiety, mild depression, and a major case of imposter syndrome.  Anxiety and depression can be linked to ADHD, but my imposter syndrome comes from my history in academics.

Note: Everything I discuss here are from personal experience, and I am not a mental health expert.  Some stuff might be triggering to others, but I try not to do that.  Finally, if anyone is struggling and needs someone to talk to, then please do not hesitate to reach out to me, even if we do not know each other.  I am always willing to chat.

Bad Kid
-------

I was a handful to say the least as a child.  My brothers and I always joke about how our parents survived it.  I did not like to be told what to do.  If I enjoyed something, then I fully immersed myself in it, but if it was something I was supposed to do, but didn't enjoy doing it, then good luck!  I wasn't having it.  In second grade my parents and teachers began to notice that I was not willing to pay attention or listen or do anything other than what I wanted to do.  My parents decided to have me checked out by a doctor and I was diagnosed with ADHD, but on top of that they decided that I needed to be put into the special education program, because I had a learning disability; I'm not sure I believe this now, but that's what happened.

Special education in the late eighties and early nineties was a program that consisted of students being placed into special classes that were different from what my fellow students called "the normal classes".  Everyone with a learning disability was put into the same class, and so, there was a large range of abilities between the students.  I remained in special education until I graduated from high school.  I didn't really understand the difference between my classes and the normal classes until I was in middle school.

Being isolated from the general student population as a teen sucks.  I was angry, felt alone, and generally acted out because of it.  In fact, I was punk AF; painted leather jacket and all.  I hung out with the wrong crowed, and it wasn't a period of my life I am particularly proud of.  However, it is was in middle school that I had an epiphany.

Most people do not know this by I have always wanted to be a scientist.  In fact, my Dad and I made my first science project in first grade.  We made a magnet out of a battery, wire, and a nail.  Then we built a tow truck out of it.  I still have it, and I love it:

I kept my aspirations secret, because it was not cool, and I knew it was an impossible dream.  Funny story, I used to steal books about robots from the local library, because I didn't know how to check them out.

In eighth grade I had a teacher, Mrs. Flannigan, at Edison Junior High School.  We had to learn the U.S. constitution in order to graduate and enter high school.  I worked hard, and tried my best, when I took the exam with her, she handed it back, and said something along the lines of, see how well you did?  You can do great things if you try!  I recall going back to my locker and deeply looking at myself and where I was headed.  I asked myself, is this you?  Is this it?  Can I be something more?  From that point on I wiped off the eye liner, and hung up the leather, and began searching.

I was searching for who I wanted to be.  I also started caring a lot, and began questioning everything I did and was asked to do.  Special education beginning in middle school doesn't change from that point until high school.  In fact, I graduated from high school with a middle school education.  High school was a breeze because of this, and often, I didn't have to do anything and I got through.  I started to get board, and a person with ADHD gets really bored, but I was now on my search, and it paid off, only thanks to some luck.

During my sophomore year or maybe junior year my high school setup a partnership with Illinois Central College where a professor came to our high school and taught a course on CISCO Networking.  I wanted to take it, but I had to fight to it.  Since it was a normal class the school felt uneasy about me taking it, but I really wanted to.  They made me sit in a room and do a bunch of IQ tests, and then they finally allowed to enroll into the course.  That class changed my life, because it introduced me to the world of computing.  I realized that in order to be good at computing, then I had to be good at math, reading, writing, etc; that is, everything I have been ignoring most of my life.  At that point on I started trying very hard on my academics. I begin reading books on my own, and learning new mathematics and computer programming.  I really wanted to get out of the special education program, but again, they made that really hard.  I fought for the right to take the normal algebra class, and they again, allowed me to based on my performance in the networking course.  However, when I joined the course for the first time I had a panic attack, and retreated back to my usual courses.  I just didn't feel ready, but I didn't give up.

After graduating from high school I decided to enroll at Illinois Central College (ICC) studying information technology (IT), because I had it in my mind I wanted to become a system administrator.  I graduated from high school with an eighth grade education, and so I tested into the lowest of the low courses; for example, I tested into remedial mathematics which taught me how to add, subtract, count money, etc.  At ICC I basically redid high school, but I was successful.  I also got pretty bored with IT, but as a requirement I had to take a computer science course.  I enrolled in Introduction to Computer Science.  It was there I fell in love with algorithms and computer programming.  I switched to computer science, but the school started canceling all of the computer science courses due to low enrollment.
